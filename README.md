CampusSpace is a smart web and mobile app that helps students find available classrooms and working outlets in real time. Whether you need to study, charge your laptop, or relax, CampusSpace shows which rooms are free and which outlets are available, in use, or broken, combining crowdsourced reports with IoT sensor data for accurate updates.
